## Progress Summary - **Week #1:**  Monday, Oct 27 -  Sunday, Nov 2

** What we completed this week:**  
- We completed the GitHub repository setup and assigned roles to everyone.
- The virtual website mockup was fully completed, and I designed it using Figma.

** Issues / blockers encountered:**  
-  I worked on learning Figma and selecting appropriate color schemes for the design.
-  An issue we encountered was coordinating branch usage, since team members could accidentally push changes to the same branch and create merge conflicts.

** Goals for next week:**  
-  We will begin coding the frontend based on the finalized mockup.
-  Set up our development environment and start coding the basic page structure.
